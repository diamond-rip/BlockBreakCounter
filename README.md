# BlockBreakCounter
A simple lobby gadgets plugin which gives a price to a player when the block got mined a certain times

## Note:
This plugin is made for my minecraft server, diamond.rip, and it uses my server's utilities core. Which means the project will miss some dependencies. If you somehow wish to use this plugin, you have to manually use your own utilities core.
